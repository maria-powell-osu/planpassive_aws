	- need loader bars for the images
	- minify files

SEO:
	- we need auto generate sitemaps xml
		- evertime jason adds a blog we should update the sitemap.xml
		
Calculator:
	- the numbers need commas for readability in the results page
	- whole row click for adding data in calculator is annoying and should be shorter 
	- cash on equity table when paid all cash creates really small increments for (cash on equity %), they should be large therefore creating a straight line   instead of confusing up and down
	- pie charts on the same line
	- dollar signs by pie charts
	- when add a field (such as utility and enter desc but not the other) it will show missing field but not highligth in red like the others

Backlog:
	- 
	- REST route should also authenticate user
	- prevent API attacks
	- add MOST POPULAR capability
	- db check for javascript?
	- Add replies to comments
	- Shared service calls might need to be providers
	- Admin table will need sorting and pagination
	- SASS for page colors
