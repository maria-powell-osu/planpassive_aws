- if you updated the package.json then do the following for deployment:
    1) remove nodemodie/ from gitignore and ebignore
    2) make you have run npm install with the right packages
    3) eb deploy
    4) add them back in 

    this way the node_modules only deploy when we have made changes to them

something to look into how to add command to run npm install for the web
- e.g. 
    .ebextension/node_dependencies.config
    Project/

Library1/

package.json
Dependency2/

package.json
package.json 

        commands:
    01_lib1_npm_install:
        command: npm install
        cwd: Library1/
    02_dep2_npm_install:
        command: npm install
        cwd: Dependency2/

Current Issue: cannot find the cwd directory that I provide
